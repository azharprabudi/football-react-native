This project especially i used for increase my skill in react and redux. In this app you also need some enviroment like :

Node JS Version >= 6
JDK 1.8 (Recommended)
Android Studio (SDK 22-26)
Your favorite terminal
React Native CLI
Emulator android (You can used the real device just enabled your android debugging in development mode)
Some coffee to make your eye on and keep spirit for that

But in this application i made, i am using api from football-data.org, so thank you so much for football-data.org to give me free API. But so sorry for the API KEY, i cant share with u because there a limitation with that, but you can request the api key from their official website :

1. Football data (https://www.football-data.org/)

If you already have the api key, you can fill that in some module.

1. Football data => Open ./src/config/variables.js, replace {API_KEY_FOOTBALL_ORG} with you api key

And to run this project you can follow some steps :

Open terminal
Enter you directory project
type "react-native run-android" (remember your emulator or real device already connected)
